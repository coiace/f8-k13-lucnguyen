    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
        This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide.</i>
        In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic)
        into a water bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
        In his book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".
